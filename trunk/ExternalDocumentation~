CMPT 214 Assignment 3

Everything is working according to the Assignment Outline.

To run this program, you may use the "make all" command while in the same
directory as the rest of the source files. You may also use "make tests" to
only create the files necessary to run test_scalar and test_vector.

Once the files are compiled, use ./test_scalar or ./test_vector to run the
testing programs. You should see no output for ./test_scalar if it ran
correctly, and you should see "100.000000 -50.000000" after running
./test_vector.

Use ./vecalc to run the main program, and after you have entered the number of
vector elements you want to work with, enter "h" for a list of commands you can
use.

See the test_run_log.txt to see the tests I ran for the ./vecalc program.

You can look at svn_log_V1.txt or svn_log_V2.txt to see the progression of this
program from start (V1) to finish (V2).
